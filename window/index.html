				This is a hex color-picker for you to use so that you can pick exactly the right color for your graphics. 
				The program lets you type in basic colors such as "red," "orange," and even "magenta," but this color-picker
				 will let you make a more unique color.
			</p>
			<p>
				Directions:<br>
				Here's how hexidecimal works. It is a base 16 number system, so the digits you may use are as follows - <br>
				1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.<br>
				Hex colors are similar to RGB because Red, Green, and Blue get blended together at the designated amount to make a color. 
				FF is the highest amount while 00 is the lowest. Type in any value between 00 and FF for each catagory below to get a unique color. 
				Copy the hex code that will appear below and paste it into the color input slot to achieve the same color for your graphic that you made here.
				 You <b>MUST</b> include the <b>#</b>.
