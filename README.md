# vector-graphics-maker

Make vector graphics in your browser like never before!

You can view this beauty at http://vectorgraphics.online or click the shiny green download button right here!


-- Capabilities (why I made this) --

Generates HTML: Instead of downloading bulky image design software with vector graphics capabilities, or bumbling about coding an SVG image for your website, this homemade web app will do the work for you! It will generate the code for the image and continue updating it everytime something is changed. Simply copy and paste the code to add it to your website!

Free Download: You can download the image you made as a .svg file without signing up or paying money.

Session Saving: You can save your progress and come back to it later without saving the file to your computer.

Smooth Music and Sound Effects: Not only can you see your work, but you can hear it happening too! Haha! If you decide that either is annoying, you can turn both off. Neither the music nor the SFX will come back on without your explicit permission.
